## **2025, As It Really Was**

2025 has been one of the most happening years of my life so far. It gave me memories, moments, and people that I know I’ll carry with me for a long time. This was the year my elder brother got married, the year I presented my first research paper (not a great one, but a start), and the year I finally graduated.

More than events, 2025 taught me the value of people — the impact honest friendships have, how the right company shapes who you become, and how much emotional safety matters. It also showed me parts of the world, and parts of myself, that I still struggle to articulate clearly.

This is my attempt to unwind the year, month by month.

### **January: Preparations and Pauses**

January flew by. With my brother’s wedding scheduled for early February, the entire month revolved around preparation — shopping, planning, coordinating. Academically, it marked the beginning of my final semester. I had a major project to complete and a paper to publish in order to graduate.

I had initially hoped to work on something meaningful and research-oriented, but I knew realistically that nothing serious would start until after the wedding. January was less about progress and more about anticipation.

### **February: Celebration, Chaos, and Family**

February was the most intense and joyful month of the year.

From 2nd to 12th February, life was pure celebration. After almost 6–7 years, I returned to my native place. It wasn’t just a wedding — it was a reunion. The first marriage in our generation meant the entire family came together, and the excitement was unmatched.

From listening to childhood stories of chote papa ji and chote dada ji, to dancing without inhibition, eating endlessly, and forgetting academics completely — it was raw happiness. Each day had its own ritual: Tilak, Matkor, Mehendi, Sangeet, Devipujan, Haldi, Barat — culminating in welcoming my bhabhi home.

Through all of this, I was running on paracetamol and ORS, battling high fever — but honestly, I didn’t care.

After returning home, the neighbors and friends welcomed us with crackers, dhol, and warmth. The reception on the 12th again showed me how dependable my friends are — not just in words, but in action.

Soon after, I had to rush back to college for a progress review, completely unprepared. Once again, friends became my lifeline. In a few hours, I had a PPT, a progress report, and even an idea.

Out of curiosity — and partly to test myself — I applied for the ISI Kolkata MTech exam. After the wedding, I began revisiting concepts seriously.

### **March: Hostel Life, Friendship, and Spontaneity**

March started quietly but turned into one of the best phases of my college life.

Due to a rescheduled review, I ended up staying illegally in the hostel for nearly 45 days. What followed was chaos, laughter, late nights, shared routines, and deep bonds. A 4-in-1 room somehow became home to 8–9 people at any given time.

Our routine was absurd but perfect: breakfast at 7 am, sleep till evening, work through the night, random games, pranks, Sehri during Ramzan, and conversations that made everything lighter.

Out of pure spontaneity, we planned a trip to Pondicherry at 5 in the morning and actually went. General coach, no sleep, rented scooties — it was reckless and beautiful.

Later that month, I decided to go to Tirupati on my birthday, regardless of uncertainty. Two friends joined, and we climbed Alipiri Mettu and had darshan of Shri Venkateswara Balaji. Everything fell into place effortlessly — a reminder of faith and timing.

March reminded me not to assume outcomes, especially about people.

### **April: Reality Hits**

April started peacefully, balancing work and light ISI prep. Then came the incident that changed everything.

An argument in the mess led to scrutiny, and I was asked to vacate the hostel immediately. Being an illegal resident, I had no defense. I tried everything — but by 16th April, I had to leave.

I moved to a PG, where the next 20 days were quieter and more introspective. Around this time, I realized I couldn’t attend my final review without a Scopus/IEEE-indexed paper — with barely a week left.

My guide offered no help. I panicked, contacted over 50 conference organizers, and eventually connected with **Dr. Shishir ji from MUJ**, who helped me improve my paper and get it accepted. Because of him, I completed my review on 5th May.

On 24th April, after a year as an intern, I received my first full-time employment offer. I accepted it — my first FTE.

### **May: Confusion and Clarity**

May was fast and stressful. The review hype was exhausting. Hostel breakfasts, especially Sunday poori-sabzi, became memories overnight.

I appeared for the ISI entrance exam after casually reading *Art of Problem Solving*. It changed how I approached problems. I missed the cutoff by just three questions — but the exam gave me confidence. With time, I knew I could do well.

Despite the job offer, corporate life felt suffocating. A 9–5 SDE role wasn’t what I wanted. I didn’t want to blend into the crowd.

So I applied for government and technical exams: AAI, SBI, IBPS, ISRO, IB DCIO — and decided to prepare for GATE 2026 seriously.

### **June to October: Failures, Festivals, and Faith**

Exams came and went. I failed most — some narrowly, some badly. AAI was close. IBPS sectionals betrayed me. ISRO showed promise.

September was about festivals — Ganesh Chaturthi, Navratri — reclaiming joy after years away.

October brought ISRO and IB exams again. Chhath Puja at home felt grounding. We also planned a South India trip around my convocation — a journey filled with temples, exhaustion, and grace.

---

### **November–December: Reflection and Resolve**

Convocation, travel, darshan, friendships — November and December were emotionally full. I also faced rejection again — Infosys SP/DSE didn’t work out.

We bought a residential plot — a blessing from my parents.

Looking back, I realized something painful but important:
I don’t want a mediocre life, but my efforts often fall below average.

I struggle with discipline, consistency, distraction, and self-control. I know that if I overcome these, I can do wonders.

### **Love, Uncertainty, and Waiting**

Somewhere along the way, I fell in love again — quietly, online, unexpectedly. It started as attraction but turned into something deeper. She isn’t ready, and I know that. I’m holding space without expectations, letting time decide.

---

### **Where I Stand Now**

I don’t want a typical desk job. I want research, science, or meaningful governance.

My plan is clear:

* Appear for **GATE, ISI, CMI, BARC in 2026**
* If signals are strong → give one more year
* If not → shift fully to Group A/B government roles
* Later → prepare for UPSC with stability

2025 taught me a lot — personally and professionally.
My goals for 2026 are simple but hard:
**health, discipline, and removing mediocrity from my life.**

I hope 2026 rewards honesty with effort.
